🔋 Solax Inverter Mobile App (Built with AI + BoltNew)
======================================================

This is a lightweight mobile app that visualizes real-time data from a **Solax solar inverter**, built in under an hour using AI tools like **OpenAI’s ChatGPT** and **BoltNew**.

🚀 What It Does
---------------

*   Connects to the Solax Cloud API
    
*   Authenticates using token and device serial number (SN)
    
*   Displays live inverter data on your phone
    
*   Includes a **settings screen** for:
    
    *   Manual data refresh
        
    *   Disconnecting the device
        

🧠 How It Was Built
-------------------

*   🔌 Started by making a successful API call using curl to verify access
    
*   🧾 Prompted **ChatGPT** with API response + app idea
    
*   ⚡ Used **BoltNew** to instantly scaffold a React Native app
    
*   📱 Connected to **Expo** for live mobile testing
    
*   🛠️ Adjusted the refresh functionality manually (minor code tweak)
